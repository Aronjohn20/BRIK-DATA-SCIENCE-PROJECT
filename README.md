# BRIK-DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECT

College Data Analysis & Visualization

This project involves processing and analyzing a dataset of college and university statistics to uncover trends and insights. The dataset was cleaned and filtered to the first 10,000 rows for efficient processing. Various data visualizations were created to understand factors such as student enrollment, retention rates, faculty composition, SAT scores, etc.

Steps Performed:
1. Data Processing
*Imported the dataset containing institutional information.
*Filtered the dataset to the first 10,000 rows for analysis.
*Cleaned missing or inconsistent values.

2. Data Visualization
Created multiple visualizations to identify patterns and insights, including:
Bar Charts – Comparing public vs. private institutions, student enrollments, and top states by graduation rate.
Pie Charts – Showing sector-wise retention rates and faculty composition.
Scatter Plots – Analyzing relationships between median SAT scores and average financial aid.

Tools & Libraries Used
Python – Data analysis & visualization.
Pandas – Data cleaning and processing.
Matplotlib – Data visualization.
